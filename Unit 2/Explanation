With the 5. Yeah. We may have nobody with the 5 from this class. But I'm not sure if I made this clear in my class. If I think you deserve a 5, I try my best to equate that to getting an a in this class.

Okay? If I think you deserve a 4 in your a t, then it kinda equates to getting a b in this class. Well, of course, the basis is super nice, they curve it for you. So if you end up with a b here, and then end up getting a 4 and they actually fix it, then it actually turns into a, which is kinda good for you. But at least what it is, while you're taking the course, it'd be kinda closer to b.

Okay? Then if you think you're getting a 4. Does that make sense? Yes. That's actually it's in the it's in the CEV, the document.

So that's the standard that the college award is actually seeking for. So so right now, people getting 40 as the average. On the unit test, I didn't even introduce the circuit that's actually integrated into electrostatics. I didn't put in, magnetic magnetism. That's actually the hardest part in this, course is adding magnetism to what you learned here.

So you need a good foundation for electrostatics to effectively tackle magnetism. That's, after this unit is circuit and then it's magnetism. Those 3 units are closely related. Okay? So they're kind of, like, in the model of, mechanics that you have to do in AP Physics 1.

They're all highly related. Kinematics, Newton's laws, energy, momentum, rotational momentum. They're all kinda related. So after this one, the circuit's kinda related to this, and magnetism's kinda related to this and the circuit, and they try the problems you see will combine them. Okay?

You need a good understanding here. I am not too discouraged because some of you did better than I expected. Alright. Some of you, of course, did work most of you did worse than I expected by the subject. Okay.

It's still Q1, almost at the end of Q1. Don't be discouraged. We will get there. This is in 1st If you keep working hard, we'll get there. Okay?

This is in Q1 or Q2? This is Q1. No. K. Wow.

I hope so. What is your thought? Okay. Starting with number 1. You ready to take notes?

Take good notes. They will help you Yes. I will do. In your interview. Okay?

Alright? I will accept interviews next week for this one. Okay? Alright? So be ready to do it next week is what I suggest.

Okay? I'm sorry. The the time is a limited source, limited resource. We can't expect I can't just give you an infinite amount of time to work on correction. Okay?

Alright? And I you haven't had any other homework except this thing. So you should do that. And next week, I'll see what we'll do. Okay?

Next week. I may just let you just work on the correction the whole time. Okay? But it I'll have to look at the rest of the schedule. What was the homework?

Omar? Omar. Omar. Omar direction. Omar, I'll have to think.

We don't like But, this one for sure because I think you need to do this more than anything else. Okay? So it's week 1, 2, and 3 for work due this the correction. Due today. Yeah.

For week also week 4. 4 and 5. I'm not sure. I think week 4 is also due today. No.

No. What if, like Yeah. We also we also we also we also we also we also we also we also we also we also the garage and you return it and we have something else to question. Then you should correct it by today. I am.

I pointed it I pointed out what's wrong and then the answer is over there. Right? Right? I pointed out what's wrong. Okay.

Well, let's go over this. Okay? You probably need more time to go over this. Next week, I'll spend more time going over this. That's why I'm taking my time explaining right now, but you need to admit it.

You don't even know what's going on here with electrostatics. You may think, oh, mister Kim never taught us this. I do. Okay? I don't have to teach you every little things that you need to know based on the knowledge that you've had before.

Stuff like it's a vector quantity. It's a scalar quantity. What does it imply? You need to care about direction. You need to you don't need to care about direction if it's scalar.

So that was, like, the actual biggest problem in the FRQ. I said electric field is a vector. Okay? You keep potential lines, they are scalar. I think, more than half of you forgot about that fact and then did something weird.

Okay? Alright? So, well, we'll get there. I hope, this is a learning experience. Okay?

Some of you did really well. I'm proud of you. Some of you didn't. I hope that, you will learn. And then if you learn, then I'll be I'll be proud of you if you learn from this experience.





Okay? Alright. So this is what's happening in a very small isolated sphere which turns positive q, existing in an empty region of space. A second very small sphere is moved from far away, far away to over here, far away to over here. It's positive, that's over here.

Okay? Something far away over here came, very close. Okay? Can you picture that from reading this question? Alright?

The second sphere, this little dot over here has this much charge. Okay? It's also positive. 2.0 times 10 to the negative 9th column, okay? Moves closer to the first period, constant speed is coming at a constant d, Right?

The second sphere passes through the circular equipotential lines due to the of course, obviously, this thing can have an equipotential line like this. Right? Oops, what the Oops. What? It went away.

It's fine. Right? It's gonna We can put that in a way like this. Right? And then this red thing, this little thing is gonna come at it.

Right? Right? 2 of these lines are separated by distance. So these 2 can represent maybe like some volt here, some volt here, and then say that they are separated by this distance given. Right?

And have potentials of a 100 and a 150. Probably the one closer is 150. The one that's further is 100. Right? Because it's fast to charge, so as you go further, the potential is gonna decrease.

Right? And it's getting closer so you you go through a 100 and then you go through a 150. Okay? What is the magnitude of the average force needed to move the second sphere between the 2 equipotential lines? Well, we know the potential difference.

Right? Right? It's 50 volts. Okay? And we know the charge.

Right? We multiply it, then what do we get? Then we get the energy. Right? Right?

The energy date may probably lost while going through that. Right? Yes. So this divide by the charge. Right?

And then this is energy, so so you have to look at the work done by the positive charge that was there. Right? This is so we gotta also divide it by the distance, then it becomes 4th. Work equals 4 times distance. What do you get?

What did we get? What did we get? 50 We get hold on. Oh, no. No.

No. Sorry about that. It's a voltage times the charge Times the charge divided by z. Divided by the distance. Okay?

And you get 5 times 10 to the negative 6 newtons. Any question about this one? No. Does this make sense? Yes.

So potential difference is 50 volts. Right? Yeah. Right? Yes.

And then the charge times the potential equals to potential energy. Right? And you gain that much potential energy through the work done by something that's external that's pushing it in at a constant velocity. Right? Right?

That's basically what happened. So that energy divided by distance is equal to the force required to push it through that. Okay? Average force. Any questions?

Everybody got it? Okay. Number 2. I think this was the only capacitor question here. You'll get more, I think, the next unit because the capacitors are used in a circuit.

Okay? Alright? The figure shows 2 different capacitors made of identical parallel, conducting plates in capacitor 1. The plates are separated by different d. We're gonna be in this equation.

Right? Kappaepsilon0a over d. Obviously, a is staying the same. Right? And then from capacitor 1, you edit it to be 2 d.

Right? Yes. The capacitance copper, do you say it's 2 k or 2 kappa? No. It's just still 2 kappa.

Just kappa. 2 kappa. Yeah. Just kappa. What why is that the double?

Just 2 k. Why? Wait. It's a cross sectional area. Area is?

This area. This area. Oh, so How much area? Okay. The dielectric should fill up the whole space, okay, between the 2 parallel plates in a capacitor.

So cap is the same, and just the distance becomes 2. Okay? Alright? In this equation for capacitance. Which of the following indicates whether the claim is correct or incorrect and provide a valid justification or whatever is the claim?

What's the claim that the capacitance of capacitor 2 is the same as the incorrect. Right? Yeah. They shouldn't be equal. So it's either c or d because doubling the thickness of the dielectric material will cause the capacitance to double.

No. Incorrect because doubling the distance between the plate will reduce the capacitance by half. That's correct. Okay? Kappa, if you change the dielectric material with What is kappa?

Thing. Kappa. Dielectric constant. Dielectric constant Of kappa. To be twice.

This is a Greek letter. I thought it was just k. It's not. It's k. It's k.

It's k. You're right. It looks like this. It's like this. Okay.

Any question about this one? No. Okay. Alright. Spirit x and spirit y.

Most of you messed up here. Small solid spirit x is made of an insulating material. Okay? So sphere x, the charges inside are not really gonna be moving freely. Okay.

Okay? It has negative charge distributed, so it'll be like this. Okay? Right? Throw out its volume.

Throw out its volume. Throw out its volume. So it's it's distributed throughout its volume. And then it's got it's more likely to stay that way. Okay?

I think that's fine. A sphere y is conductor. Right? It's a sphere. Sphere y is conductor, negatively charged.

So when you put them what the when you put them what's wrong with this? Oh, what the okay. When you put them together, sphere x is gonna be more or less like this or like this. But then the sphere y, they don't like the negative charges from the sphere x. So it's gonna go like that.

Right? Oh. Because it's not gonna. So the answer is c. Okay?

Oh, let's o o o. Make sense? Yeah. Does this make sense? Yeah.

Yeah. Okay. Number 4. Number 4. This is a classic AP Physics 2 kind of a question.

You shoot some kind of proton or electron through a parallel plate where it'll, experience some uniform electric field. Okay? Moving horizontally. As it enters its parts of the towers, the obviously, the electric field is like this. Right?

Pretty obvious. Right? Yes. Then it means when it enters, it's gonna experience the force downward. Right?

Yes. Right? So what happens to the v x? It should stay constant. Constant, constant, constant.

Get it. Out of here, it doesn't really help with only 3 choices. V y, its force is down this in that direction, so it was going horizontally, so it starts from 0. Oh. Right?

It was moving horizontally. So it starts from 0, a vertical velocity, and goes down. Okay, Sobhi. Yes. I just call you Does this make sense?

Yes. Yes. Does this make sense? I got 2 cracked up. Hey.

Hey. Hey. Hey. Yeah. I've heard you.

Any questions? Any questions? Any questions? No. Okay.

5. Oh, so this is like an induction kind of problem. Right? And some polarization of charges inside a conductor. A b c.

A has positive q, and b c are uncharged. Sphere b is here in context. Oh, this is totally charged by induction right here. Okay? I made you do it.

So you should remember this one I did it alive. And do it. Yeah. Okay? So after this, they moved it like that.

So this side should become like positive over here and the negative over here because of polarize No. No. No. No. No.

The negative. Negative over here and positive over here due to polarization. Can When they put the form, it becomes positive, negative. Was like a link. Positive cue here.

Right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

What? So b and c, b is negative. Later. And c is positive. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. D was the only choice with c or b as negative. Yeah.

Okay? Okay. Any question about this 1? No. Okay.

6. This 1, AD? Okay. Never mind. A small amount of charges placed on both an isolated conducting sphere and an isolated insulating sphere.

So you have one conduct zone. One insulator. Okay? For both charges added at a small area at the top of the sphere, After a few seconds, we're on each of the sphere. So the insulating 1 14 about that.

It'll stay at the top. It'll stay at the top for insulating 1 because the charges don't travel. Conducting 1, it'll spread all over the surface. Spread all over the surface. The sea is correct.

Oh, oh, I'm saying. Can you explain like Correct. What? Can you explain again? Okay.

So Insulating 1, the charges are not gonna be traveling freely in its body. They'll just stay at the top. Conducting 1, I place it over here. I sprinkle some charges at the top. Right?

But soon after, it'll reach try to reach an electrosteady equilibrium by spreading it. Right? Because that's what happens. Right? On a conductor, it'll all go to the surface, on the surface evenly, right, if it's a sphere.

Okay? That's why. Okay? Spread over the surface. Exactly.

Number 7. I mean, this test wasn't really that hard. This test really wasn't that hard. I think I should I mean, like, it's such a breeze. Right?

It's such a breeze. Yeah. Because of I'm like, there is no trick here. Because you're. There is no trick here.

Because you're. What's hard about this? What's hard about this? I should drop physics. I think I shouldn't have.

Okay. Some students are trying to determine whether okay. Listen. Whether the radius of a metal sphere affects the amount of charge that it can hold. Well, does it matter?

The synapse have metal spheres of different radii and known masses that can be attached to a stand like this. What kind of the dimensions? By a string as shown above. Stand is midway between a set of large plates that are connected to a battery to create a nearly uniform electric field just like a parallel plate. Alala, the students rub a rod What did it say?

With cloth and touch it to its spear to charge the spear. And they observe the deflection of the sphere as it is attracted to one plate. They keep adding charge to each sphere until they cannot observe any charge change in deflection. Which of the following data will give them information that is useful for quantitatively comparing the amount of charge on its spear? The number of times they rub the cloth back and forth on the rod.

The number of times they touch the rod to the spear. The string's angle of deflection. The string's direction of deflection. So we need to con quantitatively compare the amount of charge on each sphere. Right?

Yes. Will the angle of deflection be something helpful? Yes. How about the number of times they rub the clause back and forth on the rod? What do you think?

I choose c. I choose c? I choose c too. Why do you think this doesn't work? I wanna hear.

I don't know. Because I You don't know? Don't know. Like, this feels like it's wrong. The numbers are artist may be different, for each time they want.

Oh, you do it once. So why choose a But, like, sometimes it's really just like that. The angle is correct. I thought it's like Okay. And you explain, like, why aren't they correct?

You are so stupid. Because because it's a conducting conducting. Right? We are not always giving same amount of time. Right?

Right? It's reach trying to reach an equilibrium. Okay? Alright? So the charges on the sphere, once it accumulates, may not receive any charges from the rod.

Right? At at certain point. Okay? So it's not proportional to anything. Okay?

But this and this is how many times they rub the cloth back and forth on the rod. It's not like they do once and then do it. They do once and then do it. It's not like that. They do this.

Right? They do 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. I'm doing it. That doesn't work. Right?

I'm a robot. But then there is actually a problem that asks you to know that if you just did it once and do it, and then once and do it, unlike maybe on the insulating body, it actually adds, more or less quantitatively quantitatively consistently. Yeah. Okay? So you need to also realize about this situation.

Alright? I think that was. Alright? Okay. This one over here.

These guys these guys, man, a lot of people, I guess, forgot about, how equipotential lines would look like over here. Especially for number 9. But let's say, let's look at number 8. You see the situation? Do you remember the situation?

Yes. So which of the following hay? Okay. Which of the following best describes the location of a point other than infinity at which the so we are limited to these three regions. We're not going off to infinity and beyond.

Okay? Which the net electric field created by the 2 charges is equal to 0. This is gonna have electric field like this. Right? And then this guy is gonna have it like this.

Right? Right? But this one is 2 times. This is 1. So there are 2 possible regions.

1 is region 1. 1 is region 2. Okay. Region 2. So region 1, it's 1 this way from this guy, and then it's this way from this guy at region 1.

Right? So region 1 is possible. One other one has region 1. So let's just say. Oh, yeah.

No. Right? But you have to realize this because in region 3, it doesn't really work because it's positive to q. It's positive to q. That's right.

At the p. Yeah. I'll cut each other. In positive 2q, it will always be positive. No 0.

Okay? Right? In negative q, if it's close it's closer to negative q, reason 1 is. But then the other one is 2q, so it can have 0. Inside the reason 2, it doesn't work.

Right? Do you understand? Yes. Yes. You have questions?

That's my math skills so bad. Can we use this, like, the coulomb's law to calculate this thing? I mean, that's basically what you need for the electric field is based on coulomb's law. Am I wrong here? Any questions?

Is this right? I hope it's wrong. You hope it's wrong? Yeah. I hope it's wrong.

Why do you think it's wrong then? It is correct. It is correct? So I think it is correct. Do you hope?

Oh, is this correct? Number 8. Is it a? Is it region 1? Why not?

Because some of them hope it's wrong. I hope it's right. No. I hope it's right. I hate I hope it's right too.

I got it incorrect. No. I I can't say it. I really know how to do this. Oh, yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yes.

Okay. Okay. You don't have to. I think they know. They know it based on this high school.

Explanation. Okay. Number 9, I think number 1, this is where you started to forget that the potential is scalar. Potential is scalar. So you calculate a certain value at certain point.

You calculate a certain value at this point from the other charge. You just add it. There is no direction in in electric potential. Right? So let me erase it.

So for electric potential, it's gonna more or less look like this. Right? And it's also gonna have some negative coming off. Right? And What?

It's more. It's gonna be for something like this. Right? Because 2 q is more. Right?

That's gonna be more difficult. Right? I'm 0. And then the 0 is gonna look something like What do you mean? Look at this.

The zero line. Okay? Where are they equal? What do you mean? Region 1.

Okay. Region 1. And 2. Oh, no. No.

You don't want 1 2. Okay? Alright. If you drew the electro elect oh, what is it? Well, you could potential lines.

You see that this one's gonna be stronger. Right? So it's gonna vanish. Right? And then at some point, it's gonna they're gonna be equal, and then have a line where there's a zero potential.

Obviously, it's gonna be closer to this one. Right? And then it's gonna curve back and then connect. Why is why is it also region 1? Why is it also region 1?

So you have some negative potential over here. Like, further away, over here maybe, negative potential coming from this one should equal to the positive potential Oh. Coming from this one over here. Okay? I mean, this drawing is not to scale, obviously.

But this line is gonna connect back here somewhere. Okay? It's not to infinity. It's maybe further. Right?

But still region 1. Right? Any questions about this one? Does this make sense? Oh, yes.

Oh, yeah. So so she needs well, you means that this line is on region 1 and 2. Yeah. The blank line is basically where the potential is 0. And it's not a straight line.

Right? Where if they have the same amount of charge, it'll be like a straight line, the zero one. But it's not, so it's gonna be more like this. Okay? It'll be like, woah, like this, and then like, woah, like this.

Okay. Number 10. Any questions so far? So far so good? So far so good.

We have so fast. So we use so fast. So easy? So far so fast. So far so simple.

So far so simple. So far so simple. No. Hell. So far so Disaster.

Oh, my back's dis I know. But this is a disaster as well. So help me. What do you mean? 2 charged metal spheres are connected by a conducting wire.

Okay? Oh, this one. This one was based on one fact that you were supposed to remember is that, oh, when you have a conductor with charges, which surface becomes a you keep potential surface. Yes. What does it mean by you keep potential surface?

It means that at the surface there are equipotentials also. Okay. Can you explain that again why it's a c? I told you Uh-huh. Has charges.

Right? Mhmm. It's conductor. Right? Mhmm.

So it's just gonna equilibrium. Right? Equilibrium. Right? Right?

For a conductor, electric potential If you draw if you are to draw it, this much all have same potential. Same potential. Okay? Right? And then and then you draw like this.

Like this. Okay? So on and so forth. Okay? So at the surface of a conductor, the potential I like it.

It's it's a potential surface. And I mentioned this. Definitely. So the magnitude of the electric potential is the surface of sphere a compared to that at surface of sphere b. They're all connected.

Right? They're all conducting same conducting body. So they should have same electric potential because it's a potential surface. Okay? Yes.

Okay. Alright? Okay. Okay. So did you say And another way of reasoning is that this all has the, electric field line that's perpendicular to the surface.

Right? Right? That's perpendicular to the surface. And if you connect and then I told you, your potential line is also perpendicular to the electric field. So if you connect it, it just it just follows the surface.

Eat poop. Don't eat poop. Okay. 11. F r q.

I didn't intend this to happen. I did not intend hey. Listen. Everybody listening. I didn't intend this to happen, but it turned out, this problem was, like, almost exactly the same problem as, 2 years ago.

S j took the same test. Question. Oh. You you broke it. Come on.

So, if he he kept it, if he kept this the test that he took too long ago, then you may have, your eyes on it beforehand. That was my mistake. Nice, brother. But then I also checked again, but it was slightly different, actually. So I just let it happen.

How did it how is it, like, slightly different? They use the same picture as this, and then they use same as this, but then, like, the question style is a little different. Oh. Yeah. Like, they it's the same exact situation, but then how they, how they, phrase the questions a little bit.

You remember the situation? Do you remember the situation here? Yes. Yeah. Alright.

Let's go. I realized that actually I gave you a bit more time. If this was meant to be for only 25 minutes in an AP, you only are supposed to have 2 minutes per question. So the only required time for you to complete this on an AP level, on an actual AP exam, would have been just 45 minutes, but I'll give you 50 minutes. So yeah.

Compare the magnitude of the electric field. Okay. Magnitude of the electric field, n x. So from positive q, it's gonna be this. Right?

From positive this q, it's gonna be this. Right? It's gonna be 0 from these 2, but then another thing is that this negative q will come at it like this. Right? This negative q it's gonna come at x like this.

Right? Right? Right? So at x, you have a slightly slight electric field towards the left. Okay?

Because you basically have these 2 of them cancel each other out. Right? And then you have a little bit coming from the negative chart. Does that make sense? And then this y, and then at point y, q this way, negative q this way.

Right? So they help each other out, and also this one also helps actually. Right? Right? All 3 charges help at y in the same direction.

I was being extra nice on letter a. Even if you don't say everything that I just mentioned, I tried to give you points. Okay? But, the the rubric expected you to say a bit more in some way mostly, but then, it's kinda same thing. And I'll just give you points.

Okay? Point is 8. 2. Looks like a layer. Nice level.

What you do? 2 in 8. Okay. Hey. English.

Okay? It's English. Okay. It's not. Okay.

Our next challenge for us must okay. Here. I remember May specifically asking me about this type of stuff in one of, the executes. There is an external force. Somebody external.

Okay? This force has to do some non zero work. So what is this question asking for? It's the work done by this external force. That's what this question is about.

Okay? And it's not 0. It's either negative or positive work done by this external force to move this proton to point x. It's hard to. Okay?

Indicate whether the work is positive or negative. The true scenario is that this proton is moved from far away. It's from far away. It's like over here or it's over here. Right?

Doesn't matter. It's from far away. By the way, if you remember your whole word question Far away, it doesn't If from far away, then you just add all the charges. Right? Yes.

And so for this, it just it just behaves like a single positive queue, right, from far away. Right? I'm over here. I'm over here. Let's say your point is over here.

So from this point of view, that thing is basically just a positive q to me. Right? From far away. And I have to move this proton, put it over here. Okay?

Or put it over here. Right? Either one from far away, it's basically, basically, positive. Proton is positive, so they repel each other from far away. Right?

So I need to push it. Right? I need to push it. And then the displacement is towards it. This positive works on by the external Right?

Right? Right? Yeah. Positive work done by external force. Shouldn't be a positive.

Positive? Because this is maybe from far from far away to here, and then they this kind of a charge, they they were supposed to get it. Okay? The justification, I said it. Right?

It's because from far away, this three particle system was behaves as, positive q. Right? Proton is positively charged, has a positive charge. So the external force must push toward it, right, which is in the same direction as the displacement of the proton. Right?

Yes. Right? It's going this way and then pushing this way. Right? What if this was negative?

It wants to go there. Right? Right? Right? Then if I wanna just place it over here or wherever, and then I wanna put it to a stop, then I have to push the opposite direction.

Right? And it'll keep going this way, and I have to push the opposite direction. Because he wants to go there. So that'll be negative one if this was a electron. Okay?

Alright? So that's the difference. Okay? I have to hold it back from wanting to go there. So that's speed.

Any questions? Oh. Any questions? So No. Like, everything I need is the same.

Work done is positive. Work done by the external forces. Okay? Alright? The work required to move an individual proton from far away to point x.

Okay. Now we have to differentiate between point x and point y. I mean, I'll put it over there. And I'll put it over there. Okay?

Now there w x, w y. Justify your answer using the concept of electrical potential. Electric potential. Some of you don't even mention electric potential. I'll try electric potential.

Some of you don't even don't even try. What you say because you need to justify using the electric potential. I can't understand. What do you not understand? You have a question?

No. Like, I understand now. I understand. I said in the test, like, what the heck is this? Oh, using the test, we did.

Okay. So this system of charges, okay, if I'm far away if I'm far away, how much electric potential do I have from far away? 0. I could assume it says 0. Right?

K q over r super big, they usually approach to 0. Right? Right? So I start from 0. Okay?

If I start from 0, what I get at point x and what I get at point y equals to the electric potential at that point. Right? And at that y, at that x. I can say, no. Electric potential is scalar.

So you gotta add the potential from this guy over here, and then from this guy over here. And then subtract the potential from this guy over here because it's a scalar. I understand. Right? Do you understand?

Yes. Do you understand? So you add them here. Right? But then these 2, the positive ones are closer to x.

Right? Yeah. And then the negative one that you subject is kinda far away. This one is basically when you add the potential from positive and then this one, they will cancel out. Right?

Add y? Because they're same they're same distance, and then different sign. Right? Right? And then you just add the one from this guy over here, add y.

So at y, you have less electric potential than at x. Okay? Can you say like that? But you are coming from 0 potential. Right?

You have to push it. X, you end up having a higher potential than this one. So you need to put in more work to place it at x. Okay? So w x is higher because the electric potential at point x is higher because when you add the electric potential from each charge, x is closer to both positively charged particles.

Okay? And then y is closer to one that's negative and one that's positive. Okay? Positive. So excess more.

And then what is it? D. Now you this is expressions, by the way, are correct. If you actually add all the electric potential from each charge at point x and at point y, they are correct. By the way, this is a basic arithmetic.

Do you know how to subtract 4 by 2 over 3? 4 minus 2 over 3 is 10 over 3. Let me ask you, is 10 over 3 bigger or smaller than 2 over 3? That one's smaller. You tell me.

D. Right? So that's the first comparison we can make here. Is that, oh, expression 2 has higher or delta u. Expression 1 has lower delta u, relatively speaking.

Right? Right? Yeah. All the all the rest of the letters are all the same, keq over d, keq over d. Okay?

Alright? Okay. Do you understand here? Yes. But it's there it's it's So for d, now we want to look at delta u y.

I said just earlier What? Both of them are correct. Both of them are correct. They're both correct. But then they don't tell you which is which.

Right? They don't tell you which is which, and you have to find Uh-huh. Which delta u y, which delta u here is delta u y. Alright? And I said earlier, right, based on my explanation, that at point y, potential is lower.

Right? So the one with lower delta u is the current expression. Right? Right? And it's actually if you actually do the math, these are correct.

Is that Okay? If I say Based on this is terminated here. Okay? If I say that expression t represent the delta d one, Does it have any points? What?

I say that expression 2 represent the change in the tangent. It's not my fault. I thought it would No. Delta u y is the expression 1. That's what I just said.

Delta u y is expression 1. It's expression 1. Okay? Alright? You want me to actually show you the calculations?

Okay. Let me tell you the electric potential over here. Okay? Let me just calculate v. I mean, q is the same.

Right? Question. V equals to kq over r. This one is bq. This one has bq.

This one is bq. So all that matters is r. Right? So red is from this one at point y is k negative q over d over 2. Right?

So that's basically negative 2 k q over d. Right? Blue on this thing. Same. Right?

Except it's positive. Obviously, if you add these, this is gonna become what? 0. All that matters is the green one over here. Right?

The green one is K positive q over What's the distance here? 3 d over 2. Right? Right? 1.5d.

3 over 2d. Right? That is 2kq over 3d. Right? You multiply this by q on both side, which makes it like 2qq 2kqq over 3d, or you could replace this by e e.

It becomes 2 k e q over 3 d. 2 k e q over 3 d is delta UI. Okay? Alright? Okay.

Okay? This one you add add this one, you double it because it's both t d over 2. So it becomes kq over No. 4 kq over d, and then you subtract the one coming from the negative key. Okay?

Alright? So right? 4 key EQ over d minus subtracted by the the negative queue, negative check. So it's in a way kinda tells you that yeah. Okay?

You could have explained it in a way like this. I mean, you could have just done everything that I've said in your justification. Okay? Or you could have just shortened it by saying, oh, at point y. It must be smaller because 2 of them cancel each other out, and then you just have one left.

And expression 1 has a lower delta u, so it must be for y. Makes sense? Makes sense? Can I move on? Yes.

Oh, it's weird over time, actually. I'll continue next week. Okay. Because this time, I got 2 times better than
